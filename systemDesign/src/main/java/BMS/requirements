create book my show where user can book tickets for a show
it should be thread safe, that multiple users shouldn't book the same seat
we want to make sure there is dynamic pricing for show
after booking the ticket the user will get notification on email, phone
system should support multiple payment strategies
in this we will not lock the entire system, instead we will apply lock only on that show
