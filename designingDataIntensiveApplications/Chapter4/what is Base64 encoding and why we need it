while transmitting image file or textual data over the network, we have to convert that data base64 encoded string but it increases the size.

To understand how converting the binary representation of "cat" to Base64 increases the size, let's walk through the process step by step.
Step 1: Binary Representation of "cat"

The binary representation of "cat" is:

    'c': 01100011
    'a': 01100001
    't': 01110100

Putting these together, the binary representation for "cat" is:

01100011 01100001 01110100

This is a total of 24 bits (or 3 bytes, since each byte consists of 8 bits).
Step 2: Base64 Encoding

Base64 encoding takes binary data and represents it as ASCII characters. It works by dividing the binary data into chunks of 6 bits because Base64 uses 64 different characters (2^6 = 64). The character set used in Base64 includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and two additional symbols (typically + and /).

    Convert Binary to 6-bit Groups: The binary data for "cat" is 01100011 01100001 01110100, which we need to split into 6-bit segments.

    Here's how the bits break down:

011000 110110 000101 110100

    Add Padding if Necessary: Base64 encoding requires that the input be a multiple of 3 bytes (24 bits). Each 6-bit segment maps to a Base64 character. If the input does not align with 6-bit segments, padding (=) is added. In this case, since we have 3 bytes, we get 4 Base64 characters without needing padding.

    Mapping to Base64 Characters: Each 6-bit group corresponds to a specific Base64 character:
        011000 → 24 → Y
        110110 → 54 → 2
        000101 → 5 → B
        110100 → 52 → 0

    Thus, the Base64 encoded string for "cat" becomes:

Y2F0

Step 3: Size Comparison

    Original Binary Size:
        The original binary representation of "cat" is 3 bytes (or 24 bits).

    Base64 Encoded Size:
        The Base64 encoded representation is 4 characters. Since each Base64 character is stored as a byte in ASCII, this results in 4 bytes.

Conclusion

Converting "cat" to Base64 increases the size because:

    The original binary representation is 3 bytes.
    The Base64 encoded representation is 4 bytes.

Thus, the size increases by approximately 33% (from 3 bytes to 4 bytes). This is a common characteristic of Base64 encoding, making it less efficient for storage compared to raw binary but useful for transmitting binary data over text-based protocols (like JSON or XML) where binary data might cause issues.

Padding

    If the number of bytes in the original data is not a multiple of three, Base64 adds padding with the = character to ensure the encoded output is a multiple of four characters.

Example

For example, if you encode the string "cat" (which is 3 bytes):

    The Base64 encoded output is Y2F0.
    If you had a 1-byte input (e.g., A), it would be encoded as QQ==, where == is padding to make the total length a multiple of four.

This table helps you understand how any binary data can be encoded into a Base64 string, making it suitable for transmission in text-based formats.
