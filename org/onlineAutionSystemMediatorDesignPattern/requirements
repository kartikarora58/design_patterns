Design an online auction system.
1. There will be bidders, who can bid amount.
2. First auctioneer will get the bid amount of a bidder and will notify other bidders.
3. Bidders are not directly interacting with each other.


Responsibilities of a bidder
    can sendNotification to auctioneer(I want to place a bid of amount);
    can receive notification from auctioneer, if someone else has placed the bid.
    Thus, it means bidder is interacting with the auctioneer.
    So, bidder will have auctioneer object


Responsibilities of an auctioneer
    receive the bid by a bidder
    notify other bidders.
    Thus, it will have list of bidders



<<Colleague>>
     placeBid(int amount)
     receiveBidNotification(int amount)

Bidder
    AuctionMediator
    ---------------------
    placeBid(int amount)
    receiveBidNotification(int amount)


<<Mediator>>
    addBidder(Colleague bidder);
    placeBid(Colleague colleague,int amount)



Auctioneer
    List<Colleague> colleague
    ----------------------------
    addBidder(Colleague bidder)
    placeBid(Colleague colleague,int amount)
