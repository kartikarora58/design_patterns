Suppose we want to create robot object

Robot
    int height 4 byte
    String type (humanoid/computer) 50 byte
    int x 4 byte
    int y 4 byte
    Sprite shape 30 kb

on an average an objects require 31 kb

and if we want to create 1 lakh objects then it will be 31 lakh kb of space
which will give out of memory error

one thing we can notice from above is that height type and shape of particular robot will remain same
for all human robots these parameters won't change
and these types which are common are called intrinsic states
and x any y position will different they are call extrinsic states


1. remove extrinsic properies.
2. initialize intrinsic properties using constructor
3. remove setter methods because intrinsic properties once initialize can't be changed.
4. inorder to initialize extrinsic properties we will use method.
5. If we want to create new robot we will get the object from cache
