In splitwise
we create group
where one person split the expense and it is equally divided
However in out app
we want below functionalities
1. unequal distribution (i.e if 100 is split among three persons one person would be paying 50 and other two would be paying 25 each)
2. another scenaior where(out of 3 only b and c have to pay(50) but on their behalf a has paid 50 but a haven't eaten anything
so b have to pay 15 and c has to pay 35)
3. a and b only went to shopping where b paid on behalf of a

we have to cover all these functionalities

Let's take a scenario

suppose a group of 4 friends went to trip
every time either some of them are involved or all of them are involved
some paid on some behalf so, rather then settling each expense individually
we will find out over all who will paid whom
Expense -1 total amount = 300
paid by
a-100
b-200

had to pay
a-50
b-50
c-100
d-100

balance
a=50(will get this much amount since he has paid 100 but his share was only 50)
b=150
c=-100(-100 means c has to pay this much amount)
d=-100(d has to pay this much amount)

------
expense - 2 balance
a=-500
b=-500
c=1000
-------
expense - 3 balance
a=-40
b=-10
c=50


now in order to find the outstanding amount
we will add amount of individual user

a = -490
b = -360
c = 900
d = -50

if you add up all the amounts it will be zero

now we will arrange every user in clockwise direction


a will pay to b will pay to c and d will pay to c (this is one such approach)

a will pay b
a will have 0 and b has to pay 850
b will pay c so c is now expecting 50 more
c won't pay anyone but d will pay and c will receive the remaining 50
by this the amount associated will every user will become zero
another strategy

negatives are borrowers
and postive are lenders

find maximum borrower and maximum lender
borrower will pay to lender

borrowers are
a = -490
b = -360
d = -50

lenders are
c = 900


first a will pay c
a becomes zeer
