Elasticsearch provides a variety of data types to handle diverse data efficiently. These types are defined in mappings, which describe how documents are indexed and stored in Elasticsearch.
Core Data Types

    Text:
        Used for full-text search.
        Examples: Articles, product descriptions.
        Analyzed by default (tokenized into terms).
        Example: "type": "text"

    Keyword:
        Used for structured data (exact matches, aggregations, sorting).
        Examples: Tags, email addresses.
        Not analyzed.
        Example: "type": "keyword"

    Numeric:
        Long: For 64-bit integers.
        Integer: For 32-bit integers.
        Short: For 16-bit integers.
        Byte: For 8-bit integers.
        Double: For 64-bit floating points.
        Float: For 32-bit floating points.
        Example: "type": "integer"

    Date:
        Stores date and time.
        Supports multiple formats (ISO 8601 default).
        Can store milliseconds since the epoch.
        Example: "type": "date"

    Boolean:
        Stores true or false.
        Example: "type": "boolean"

    Range:
        Stores ranges of values:
            integer_range, float_range, long_range, double_range, date_range.
        Example: "type": "integer_range"

Complex Data Types

    Object:
        Stores JSON objects (nested key-value pairs).
        Fields are indexed as separate entries.
        Example:

    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "field1": {"type": "text"},
        "field2": {"type": "keyword"}
      }
    }

Nested:

    Similar to objects but keeps the relationship between nested fields intact.
    Used for advanced querying of nested structures.
    Example: "type": "nested"

Array:

    Elasticsearch supports arrays of any data type.
    Example:

        "tags": ["elasticsearch", "search", "indexing"]

Specialized Data Types

    Geo-point:
        Stores latitude and longitude coordinates.
        Example:

        "location": {
          "type": "geo_point"
        }

    Geo-shape:
        Stores shapes like polygons, lines, etc., for spatial data.
        Example: "type": "geo_shape"

    IP:
        Stores IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
        Example: "type": "ip"

    Binary:
        Stores binary data (Base64 encoded).
        Example: "type": "binary"

Runtime Fields

    Allow defining fields calculated at query time.
    Types: keyword, long, double, date, and boolean.
    Example:

    "runtime": {
      "type": "keyword",
      "script": {
        "source": "doc['field'].value + '_suffix'"
      }
    }

Understanding these data types is essential for designing efficient Elasticsearch indices and optimizing queries. Let me know if you'd like more details or examples!
