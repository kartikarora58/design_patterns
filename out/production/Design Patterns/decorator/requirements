decorator design pattern is use used when we want to add behaviour to an existing object
and in doing so we want to calculate the effort required

Suppose we want to make pizza
we selected pizza base and on the top of that we have options to choose toppings
and when we add behaviour we want to add extra cost as well


<<pizza>>
    int getCost();


<<Ingredient>> extends <<pizza>>
