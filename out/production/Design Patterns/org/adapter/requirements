adapter design pattern used to connect two incompatible objects
 It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, making them work together
 1. Suppose you are sending a url and that url expects json as payload
 2. however, Your have xml as payload so you will use adapter design pattern


Json
    string jsonString
    -------------------
    getJsonString()


Xml
    string xmlString
    --------------------
    getXmlString()


Adapter extends Json
    xml
    -------------------------
    getJsonString()
