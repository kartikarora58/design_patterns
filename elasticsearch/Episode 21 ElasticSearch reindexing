In Elasticsearch, updating a field's type is not directly possible because the type of a field determines how data is indexed, stored, and searched. Changing a field's type requires creating a new index with the updated mapping and reindexing the data.
Steps to Update a Field's Type in Elasticsearch

    Export Existing Mapping: Retrieve the current mapping of the index to understand its structure.

GET /your_index/_mapping

Create a New Index with Updated Mapping: Create a new index with the desired changes in the mapping. For example, if you want to change a field age from integer to text:

PUT /new_index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "age": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "name": {
        "type": "keyword"
      }
    }
  }
}

Reindex Data: Use the _reindex API to copy data from the old index to the new one.

POST /_reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "your_index"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "new_index"
  }
}

Verify the Data: Confirm that the data and mapping in the new index are correct.

GET /new_index/_mapping
GET /new_index/_search

Delete the Old Index (Optional): After verification, you can delete the old index to free up resources.

DELETE /your_index

Alias Management (Optional): If your application uses an alias for the index, update it to point to the new index.

    POST /_aliases
    {
      "actions": [
        { "remove": { "index": "your_index", "alias": "current_index" } },
        { "add": { "index": "new_index", "alias": "current_index" } }
      ]
    }

Why Can't You Directly Update a Field's Type?

    Indexing Behavior: Elasticsearch pre-defines how data is stored in its reverse index based on the field type. Changing it mid-way could lead to inconsistency.

    Data Integrity: Reindexing ensures the data is re-analyzed and indexed according to the new type.
