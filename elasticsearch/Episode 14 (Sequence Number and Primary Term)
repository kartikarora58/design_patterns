What are sequence number and primary term in elastic search ?

Replication group consists of 1 primary node and 2 replica node.

Suppose data is in primary shard and is being replicated to other 2 replicas.
After being replicated to Replica R1 the primary shard fails.
Now R2 becomes the primary shard by voting mechanism.
However, R2 doesn't contains the data.

Primary term represents -> How many times the primary shard was changed.
Sequence number represents counter for each write operation.

There are two more terms global and local checkpoint
local checkpoint is the sequence number of each node in replica group.
whereas global checkpoint is the minimum sequence number among all the nodes in the replica group.

Primary Replica1 Replica2
x+1     x+1         x
data    data        data

because primary failed before the data was replicated to replica 2

global checkpoint will be x which ensures atleast x amount of data is written to all the nodes in replica group.
