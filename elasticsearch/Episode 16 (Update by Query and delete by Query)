In Elasticsearch, an Update by Query operation allows you to update documents that match a given query. This is a bulk update operation where you provide a query to select the documents, and then specify the updates that should be applied to those documents. Unlike the regular update operation, which targets a specific document by ID, update_by_query allows updating multiple documents at once.

Hereâ€™s how to use update_by_query in Elasticsearch:

Basic Structure:
Query: Define the query that selects which documents to update.
Script: Define the script that modifies the documents.
Example of update_by_query:

POST /index_name/_update_by_query
{
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.field_name = params.value",
    "params": {
      "value": "new_value"
    }
  },
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "field_name": "old_value"
    }
  }
}

Explanation:
index_name: The name of the Elasticsearch index where the documents are stored.
script: The part that specifies the update. In this case, it changes the field_name to new_value.
query: This is where you define the selection criteria. In this case, it's selecting documents where field_name equals old_value.
